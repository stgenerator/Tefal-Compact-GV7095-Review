The Tefal Compact GV7095 steam generator iron belongs to the impressive line of Tefal steam generators, and this one boasts of a more compact size compared to its cousins.

This steam generator may not be quite as powerful as its cousins that are equipped with a five bar pressure, but the GV7095 packs in a respectable 4.5 bar pressure with 120 grams per minute continuous and variable steam, 1.6-liter water tank capacity, a patented anti-scale collector function, and Tefalâ€™s Easy Cord system, which allows for convenient storage.

Unlike its cousins, the Tefal Compact GV7095 is also perfect for smaller home spaces and those with lesser ironing tasks to finish. It is also a cheaper alternative to its bulkier cousins for those who are not managing a big household and bigger stacks of clothes to iron.

How the Tefal Compact GV7095 Steam Generator Works
The Tefal GV7095 is a more compact steam generator model from a global appliance leader, and it is equipped with the patented Tefal Ultraglide ceramic soleplate, which allows for the smoothest gliding over different types of fabrics, unparalleled scratch resistance, easy cleaning and use, and optimal steam diffusion when ironing.

The Ultraglide ceramic soleplate is good news for those who hate ironing with a passion, as it can significantly cut both the time and effort involved with the task of ironing.

Tefal Compact GV7095Like all the steam generator irons under the Tefal brand, the GV7095 is equipped with a patented anti-calc collector that will effectively eliminate scale problems in the appliance.

Hard water is a consistent problem with steam generators, and owners of such appliances dislike the fact that they should be using the more expensive distilled water instead of the kind that pours out the tap. The scale inside the broiler is converted into solid form thanks to the technology Tefal has developed, and this solid scale is collected at the side of the appliance for easier disposal.
